## Introduction
If there is n variable `x1，x2, x3, ... xn`, and m relationship `xj - xi <= ck, k in [1, m]`


## Algorithm
1. For each relationship `xi - xj <= ck`
2. Note the similarity in triangular inequality in `dist[xi] <= dist[xj] + ck`
3. Hence we can add an `edge(xj, xi, ck)`
4. For the source, we create a node `x0`, and add `edge(x0, xi, 0 ) for all i`
5. Check if negative cycle exist with SPFA
